The CCGLTouch wrapper for iOS: [http://cocoacid.org/ios/](http://cocoacid.org/ios/)
====================================================


CocoaCinderGL Touch eases the use of Cinder from within a typical XCode/Cocoa Touch project. Thus allowing C++/Obj-C creative coders to build iOS apps bearing several "Cinder sketches" as well as Cocoa sliders, buttons...

Provided here are examples that need to be placed **within a "CCGLTouch" folder**, inside of one's Cinder folder, at the same level as the "boost" libraries folder, the "samples", etc.
